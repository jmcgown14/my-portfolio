# My Profile

When the webiste is loaded you will see my name, contact information, a profile picture, and examples of my work.

You are able to click on the Navigation Links on the top of th screen to scroll to the different sections.

Since I only have one project completed so far, there is one setion that has a navigatable link. It will take you to the Refactory Challenge that we did for Week 1.

The page and contents resize to fit other media screens.
